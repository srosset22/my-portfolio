      <p>I was born in New York City, and grew up in Westchester, New York with my parents and little brother. I'm currently working
          from home in Westchester due to the Covid-19 situation. I love NYC, and hope to return to the city after graduation!
            <br>
          I'm a rising junior at Washington University in St. Louis studying Computer Science and Finance. I was first introduced to CS 
          in High School when I had the chance to attend the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, which aims to bridge the gender gap
          that exists in technology. That summer, I was exposed to various aspects of CS through real-world projects in robotics, art, and 
          website design. 
            <br>
          I'm so excited to be a STEP intern at Google this summer! While I was originally supposed to work in the Mountain View Headquarters
          in Silicon Valley, I'm very grateful for the opportunity to conduct the internship remotely this summer.
